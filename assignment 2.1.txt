Java Architecture consists of the following : 
1.Source Code
2.Java Compiler
3.Byte code
4.JVM(Java Virtual Machine)
5.Os(Operating System)

1)Source Code : Programmers write software programs using a Programming language known as Java,this language provides a series of instruction,so they can use to create the program they want.
All the instructions a programmer uses to build the program is called as Source Code.

2)Java Compiler : Java compiler is a software (or) programming language that converts a Java source program into bytecode.
We can also refer that compiling the sourcecode into native language of a particular hardware platform.

3)Bytecode : Java bytecode is the result of the compilation of a Java program.
Once Java program has been converted to bytecode it get processed by the JVM(Java Virtual Machine) instead of processor.
  
4)JVM(Java Virtual Machine) : JVM is the runtime engine of Java latform,which allows any program written in Java.
JVM consists of Java runtime environment(JRE),class libraries and other supporting components.
JRE performs the main tasks like : 1.Load the class. 2.Verifies the bytecode. 3.Interprets the bytecode
-Class Loader : Class loader loads all the class files required to excute the program,once the bytecode is loaded successfully,
	        then next step is bytecode verification by bytecode verifier.
-Bytecode Verifier : It verifies the bytecode to see if any security problems are there in code or not.
	        Once the code is verified and proven that there is no security issuses with the code,
	        JVM will convert bytecode into machine code which will be directly executed by the machine in which Java program runs.

5)Os(Operating System) : The low level software that supports a computer's basic functions,such as scheduling tasks
and controlling peripherals.Java OS is a Opearting system with a Java virtual machine as a fundamental component.
